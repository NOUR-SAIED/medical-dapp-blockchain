# 🏥 Decentralized Medical Record System

A minimal blockchain prototype where **patients own their medical records** and **control which doctors can access them**.  
Smart contracts are deployed locally using **Hardhat**, and the UI is built with **React + Ethers.js**.

---

## ✨ Features
- Patients register medical information on-chain
- Patients whitelist a doctor’s wallet address to grant access
- Doctors can view records **only if authorized**
- No third party controls data — **ownership stays with the patient**
